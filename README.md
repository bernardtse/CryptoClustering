## 1. Overview

This assignment focuses on predicting whether cryptocurrencies are influenced by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using Python and unsupervised learning. The prediction process is conducted twice: first, using the original data, and second, using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) data. The results are then compared to determine the optimal approach for unsupervised learning.


## 2. Repository, Setup and Execution
